# Meta-Transaction Voting Backend

This repository implements a gasless voting system on the MegaETH testnet using:

- **Meta-Transactions**: Users sign votes off-chain; a Relayer pays gas on their behalf.
- **Node.js + Express**: Exposes a simple API for election creation, candidate listing, results, and vote submission.
- **HardHat**: Compiles and deploys Solidity contracts.
- **Ethers.js**: Used in both Relayer and API layers to talk to the blockchain.
- **MegaETH Testnet**: High-performance EVM-compatible testnet.
